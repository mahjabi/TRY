# website of a charity club named 'TRY' from KUET(Khulna University of Engineering & Technology)
ASP.NETCore(MVC) project using appdb which can run on windows/macOS or any operating system.
Done using Visual Studio 2022.

here, i did showcase projects seeing which people from any place can donate, also added banking info, where they can donate and a clarifying form, which they have to fill after donating, to make sure the money reached.
also people can make donation request.
